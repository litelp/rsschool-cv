## About Me
========================

My experience in the field of security systems has allowed me to improve professional skills such as presentations, analytical and critical thinking, and teamwork. As a presale engineer, my tasks were: analyzing the competitive market, conducting product presentations for customers, as well as calculating and optimizing security solutions at facilities.
I also developed a “Questionnaire layout” project in Figma. This project will automate and speed up the calculation of solutions for customers.

## Code example
========================

Given two integers a and b, which can be positive or negative, find the sum of all the integers between and including them and return it. If the two numbers are equal return a or b.

Note: a and b are not ordered!

```
function getSum(a, b) {
  const min = Math.min(a, b);
  const max = Math.max(a, b);
  let sum = 0;
  for (let i = min; i <= max; i++) {
    sum += i;
  }
  return sum;
}
```
